"""Qiskit MCP Server - Model Context Protocol server for Qiskit SDK.

This package provides a comprehensive MCP server that enables AI assistants
to interact with Qiskit quantum computing functions including:
- Quantum circuit creation and manipulation
- Advanced circuit operations (composition, parameterization, decomposition)
- Circuit library (QFT, Grover, variational ans√§tze, Pauli evolution, oracles)
- Variational circuits (EfficientSU2, RealAmplitudes, TwoLocal, NLocal, ParameterVector)
- Quantum machine learning (Pauli/Z/ZZ feature maps, QAOA ansatz)
- Boolean logic gates (AND, OR, XOR for quantum search)
- Advanced algorithms (Phase estimation, IQP, hidden linear function, VQE, QAOA)
- Clifford & stabilizer operations (random Clifford, stabilizer states, Pauli tracking)
- Dynamic circuits (mid-circuit measurement, conditional gates, quantum teleportation)
- Advanced synthesis (single/two-qubit decomposition, unitary synthesis, optimization)
- Circuit utilities (inverse, copy, to_gate, to_instruction)
- QASM file I/O (load/save QASM 2.0 and 3.0)
- Circuit converters (DAG conversion, decomposition)
- Enhanced transpilation (backend, coupling map, layout, routing strategies)
- PassManager support (preset, optimization, analysis, unroll, combined passes)
- Quantum information operations (density matrices, fidelity, entropy)
- Qiskit Primitives (Sampler, Estimator)
- Result processing (marginal counts, filtering, expectation values)
- Backend execution (local simulators, IBM Quantum hardware submission)
- Job management (submit, retrieve, cancel, status checking)
- Algorithm solvers (VQE, QAOA, parameter optimization)
- Error mitigation (measurement calibration, ZNE, readout errors, dynamical decoupling)
- Simulation backends (Aer, statevector, noisy simulation)
- Noise models (depolarizing, thermal relaxation, damping)
- State preparation (W state, GHZ state, Dicke state, superposition)
- Quantum state tomography
- Circuit equivalence checking
- Circuit analysis and optimization
- OpenQASM 3.0 support
- Circuit visualization (text, matplotlib, Bloch sphere, Q-sphere, Hinton, city plot)
- Measurement visualization (histograms, distributions)
